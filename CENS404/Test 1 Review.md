### Become Who You Are - Dohm
- Set in a mental hospital we follow a 60-year old woman who was the wife of the Privy Councilor Schmidt
- Was a *well mannered housewife* now mostly silent
- reminiscent of Nietzche 
- Doctor Behrend is fascinated by the transformation
- The woman has become more youthful as she wears an old-fashioned wool dress and placed a withere myrtle wreath as her bridal wreath
- she gives doctor Behrend her old journal so that he may investigate what she was like before
- her name is *Agnes Schmidt*
- she had a brother who died in his early twenties, his parents cared for him more than her
- she married Eduard but she did not really love him or enjoy his company its just something she did, most likely socially forced upon her
- she seemed incontent with her life
- she had children who she loved greatly but as they got older they began to leave her
- she felt lost after her husband died
- her daughters made her feel like an outsider as they had married and had their own lives now
- perceived herself as frail and useless, her family would no longer take her for walks.
- She lost her sense of identity
- page 19 - "Here I am always only called the mother-in-law, and actually, I am here as mother"
	- shes the in-law since its her daughters children the male has authority and therefore shes more of an outsider?
- She begins to read, consuming modern Scandinavian, Russian, and French books that portray life as it really is and challenge traditional customs and morals. She is particularly struck by the idea that "woman is not a subordinate creature predestined for a lower function in life," a thought that feels both new and deeply familiar.
- *Appearance*: She has a fine, black wool dress made in the style of a Marie Antoinette painting and allows her long gray hair to fall freely on her shoulders.
- *Art*: She begins visiting art galleries and is mesmerized by the work of Böcklin, whose mystical colors and dream-like figures captivate her. She finds that she is moved only by things "which lies beyond the real".
- *Environment:* She removes the old crocheted doilies from her apartment and fills it with intensely fragrant flowers.

Her walks through the city bring her face-to-face with a bleak, decaying landscape and a society she feels estranged from. An encounter with a free-spirited gypsy family makes her yearn for a life of movement, horrifying her with "the idea of always having to stay in the same place". On another occasion, the "garish cheerfulness" and "dissolute, senseless" merriment of working-class families at a Sunday pub repulses her.

This alienation leads her to a bitter reflection on society's contempt for older women. She feels that an old woman is seen as "an unpleasant one," and to avoid ridicule, she stoops to "appear even older than I am". She laments that people "consider the noblest characteristics of a woman to be the spice of her young body".

Ultimately, she retreats into a profound loneliness, feeling that she can no longer be among people. She concludes by questioning if her lifelong goodness was genuine or if she was simply "tame because they had tamed me from childhood on,".
- *Philosophical Awakening and Rebellion:*
    - Agnes concludes that her lifelong dutifulness was not a virtue but a form of "Training" that "chained up my nature".
    - She rejects the idea of living only for others as a "senseless, fruitless circular course" and questions whether she had any duties to herself.
    - She has the devastating realization that she was never truly an "I"—just "A name! A hand! A foot, a body! No soul, no brain". She feels she has "lived a life in which I wasn't even present".
    - In a moment of terror, she feels as if she is trapped in a casket, fighting to push the lid open before it falls shut forever.
- *Inheritance and the Decision to Travel:*
    - Agnes unexpectedly inherits ten thousand deutsche marks from a distant relative.
    - After briefly considering giving the money to her daughter's family, she decides to keep it for herself in order to "travel, far away!".
    - She views this journey as an "ethical wanderlust" and a way to "catch a glimmer of the large world soul".
    - She struggles with her conscience but concludes that it is largely shaped by the "general opinion" of others.
- *Experience at the North Sea:*
    - She travels to the North Sea, where the powerful wind initially revives her.
    - A brief fantasy of living for another half-century is shattered when she finds she cannot physically keep up with a young girl, making her feel like "a thing begun that will not be finished, never".
    - Her sense of self begins to dissolve; she feels like "sea foam, torn out of my element" and has to repeat her own name out of fear she will forget it.
- *Visions and Final Collapse:*
    - During a storm, she has an epiphany, crying out against the "murder of the soul!". She blames no one individual but rather the fact that she was "born a hundred years too early," trapped by the unchangeable "bronze tablets of law" that dictate how a woman ought to live.
    - She mourns her unfulfilled potential as a painter or writer, feeling a creative spring inside her but having "no receptacle with which to scoop".
    - She begins having terrifying visions, including seeing her own severed head—the same one missing from the statue in the garden—emerge from the sea.
    - Realizing that the "northern wind has too highly strained my nerves" and that the sea is pulling her down, she resolves to flee somewhere with a mild climate and sun. Her journal ends with the single, desperate word: "Italy!".
- *A Paradise Found:* Agnes initially experiences Capri as a place of overwhelming beauty, freedom, and spiritual resonance. She feels it is her true "native land" (Heimat). Here, she encounters the young doctor, Johannes, and develops a profound, idealized love for him, seeing him as a "psalm" and the man she was always meant to love.
- *Rebirth and Conflict:* This love makes her feel that she has reclaimed her youth; she believes she is "really and truly eighteen years old" and that her aged body is merely "foreign skin". While she views her love as a pure connection "from soul to soul," she is terrified of how others would perceive it, noting the double standard that an old woman who loves is considered "erotically insane" while an aging Goethe was admired for the same feeling.
- *The Breaking Point:* The turning point comes when the doctor throws a bouquet of myrtle at her feet. She takes this as confirmation that her "dream" of being young is real. However, her illusion is shattered when she overhears him mockingly call her "Sappho from the _Fliegende Blätter_" and "Grandmother Psyche".
- *Descent into Madness:* The final journal entries are fragmented and chaotic, reflecting her complete mental breakdown. She feels betrayed by the man she saw as "so wise, so good, so fine," and her thoughts spiral into confusion about her own identity, repeating phrases about bronze tablets and caskets from earlier entries. The journal ends with the scattered word "ashes".
- *Final Moments:* She sits upright, wearing the thorny myrtle wreath which has cut her forehead, causing a drop of blood to run down. She mechanically plucks apart the passionflower she once took from Johannes.
- *Last Words:* With a tender smile, she speaks to the doctor, asking, "An old woman who dies from the labor pains of birth. Will my 'I' be born in death? Will I in the Beyond become who I am?".
- Her head sinks back into the pillow as she says she hears "the swan song that the sun sings. Red morning sky!". She dies with an expression of "exalted astonishment," her face transformed into a "marble statue of pure beauty".

**Gender:**
- Women are held into very strict gender roles, they must find a husband and have a family to become a mother
- Once they lose these things their *purpose* is gone which causes Agnes to begin her mental breakdown
- Women are tied to *youth* and only have "sexual worth"
**Nation:**
- Not a very political but *Germany* to Agnes is a restrictive and confined place *specifically Berlin*
- Germany is known for having strict rules and being very rules focused
- Italy is her freedom maybe references the idea that Italy has always been a place of rebirth (renaissance) and art
**Generation:**
- strong disconnect of her and the next generation
- the grandchildren *do not value her at all*
- society tells her to not speak as she is now *old*
- in contrast to the indigenous stories, elders are not valued at all or even taken care of by the younger generation
**Education:**
- teachings are done by society almost like *peer pressure*
- information was restricted for women or frowned upon for them to learn from the books
- only after her husbands death did she go and read about the world outside Germany


# Module 2
### "Song of the Germans" - August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben
**Gender, Society, and “Nation”:** 
- The poem defines the German “Nation” or “Fatherland” geographically, from the Maas to the Memel and the Etsch to the Belt. 
- It envisions a society built on fraternal unity, where "Brothers stand together" for protection. 
- Gender is addressed by including "German women" as a core component of German culture, alongside "German fidelity, / German wine and German song". 
- In this context, women are presented as cultural symbols that contribute to Germany's "old respected fame," while the active role of striving for the nation is assigned to "brothers".
**Family, Community, and Education:** 
- The poem’s central community is the "German Fatherland". It promotes a national family bound by brotherhood, urging citizens to strive "Brotherly with heart and hand". 
- While not mentioning education directly, the poem serves to inspire "noble deeds" and promote the values of "Unity and Right and Freedom".
**Generation, Tradition, and Change:** 
- the poem is a call for significant change: the unification of the German states into a single nation with "Unity and Right and Freedom". 
- This was a revolutionary concept in 1841. It also honors tradition by referencing the "old respected fame" of German culture. 
- The poem itself has undergone changes in its interpretation and use, having been misused during the Nazi regime and later having its third stanza adopted as the national anthem of the reunified Germany.
**Religion, Culture, and Race:** 
- The poem does not invoke religion. 
- Its focus is on a national and cultural identity. Culture is a central element, celebrated through "German women, German fidelity, / German wine and German song".
   
### "For All" (1847) by Louise Otto-Peters
 **Gender, Society, and “Nation”:** 
 - This poem's primary focus is the exclusion of women from the concept of the "Nation" and society's rights. 
 - revolutionary cries like "Freedom for all!" have been hypocritical because "on men alone rights were conferred". 
 - She laments that even as men achieved the status of "citizens," they denied rights to "half the populace," their sisters.
 - The poem’s vision for the nation is one of true equality "Where both sexes share the rights of the nation".
 **Family, Community, and Education:** 
 - The poem critiques a society that has educated women to believe their "highest goal" is to be "playmates for a man" or to retreat into prayer because the world didn't understand them.
 - It calls for a new community, a "realm of love and harmony," where all people are united like "the members of one body".
 **Generation, Tradition, and Change:** 
- The poem traces the call "For all" through different historical generations—from the angels at Christ's birth to the Hussite troops who applied equality to both sexes—to critique the recent male-centric revolutions. It is a call for radical change, demanding that the next revolution achieve true "Emancipation... for all!" by finally including women.
 **Religion, Culture, and Race:** 
 - Religion is used as a tool to argue for women's rights. 
 - The poem invokes Christ's "teachings... which profess the tenet of equality" and the belief that his suffering united "all believers with firm ties" as a divine precedent for universal rights. 
 - The struggle of the Hussites for religious inclusion is paralleled with the struggle for gender equality.
### "The Silesian Weavers" (1844) by Heinrich Heine
 **Gender, Society, and “Nation”:** 
- Heine’s poem presents a nation defined by brutal class division.
- It is a powerful critique of the "fatherland" as a "false name" where only "disgrace and shame" thrive.
- Society's leaders—the "rich man's king" and a God who is "deaf to our prayer"—are cursed for their indifference to the weavers' suffering. 
- The poem focuses entirely on class struggle and does not address gender.
- The "nation" is represented as the state system with a leader and a group of followers
 **Family, Community, and Education:** 
 - The poem depicts a community of weavers, united in their misery and their revolutionary anger.
 - They sit together, "Grinding their teeth," and work in unison to weave a "shroud" for Germany.
 - The poem is a collective curse, spoken in a singular "we" representing the community of middle/lower class weavers.
 **Generation, Tradition, and Change:**
 - By issuing a "threefold doom" upon God, the king, and the fatherland, the weavers reject the very pillars of Prussian society. 
 - The poem inverts the traditional Prussian motto, "With God for the King and the Fatherland".
 - The change envisioned is not one of reform but of destruction, born from hopelessness.
 **Religion, Culture, and Race:** 
 - Religion is explicitly condemned. The weavers curse God for being "deaf to our prayer / In Winter's cold and hunger's despair," accusing him of having "mocked us, hoaxed, derided".
 - The traditional craft of weaving is transformed into a revolutionary cultural act: creating a burial shroud for "Old Germany".

### "Song of a Silesian Weaver" (1846) by Louise Aston
 **Gender, Society, and “Nation”:** 
 - The speaker is a young woman who faces sexual exploitation in addition to poverty.
 - The factory owner attempts to coerce her into sex by offering money, preying on her family's desperation. 
 - Her plea, "don't think it was lust!" highlights her lack of agency and the compounding misery faced by women in her position. 
 - The focus is personal and social, not national.
 - Women are viewed very sexually whereas the man has all the responsibility - factory owner, father, caretaker
    
 **Family, Community, and Education:** 
 - Family is the central motivation for the speaker. Her father is dead, and her "loved one" was shot and killed while trying to provide food.
 - Her potential submission to the factory owner is driven by the need to care for her "poor, sick mother, / And my sister at the door". 
 - The community is a distant voice that comments on her wretched appearance, emphasizing her isolation.
**Generation, Tradition, and Change:** 
- The poem portrays a cycle of generational poverty and suffering with no hope for change. The loss of her father and her loved one has left her in a state of despair. 
- Unlike the revolutionary anger in Heine's poem, her response is a death wish. She asks God, "if you can't help me, / You'd better let us go" to the grave.
 **Religion, Culture, and Race:** 
 - In contrast to Heine's poem, the speaker here turns to religion in desperation. 
 - She does not curse God but pleads, "Oh, heaven, pray be just" and "Oh, God, if you can't help me". 
 - For her, God is a last resort in a world where she feels completely abandoned, as if "There's not one star for me!".
