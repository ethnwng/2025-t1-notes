Reuter - From a Good Family

Characters:
- Agathe - daughter of a wealthy maid family
	- strong sense of shame
	- judgy
	- cannot think for themself in their society
	- forced into a societal expectation

looks like so far that each character slots into or supports the bourgeoise class like system for males and females as well as for cultural cohorts
