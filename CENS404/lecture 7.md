review


Two Old Women -
- women forced into gender roles
- women who were not married were valued less
- old women left behind is a generational/cultural practice of old being weak

Become Who You Are 
- women forced to into the relationship of Wife & Mother
- once you lose being both you are discarded
- tried to resist it through writing and express herself but instead made it look like she was going crazy


Comparisons
- *Journey of a Travelling Girl* did not highlight gender roles as much as *Become Who you Are* or *From a Good Family*
- *Become Who You Are* and *From a Good Family* show how the impact of gender restrictions shown as a tragedy
- in contrast, *Two Old Women* does not let the negative gender roles affect them but fuel them to survive
