plural endings basic rules
1. No Change: 
2. add **(e)n**, **nen**
3. No ending + umlaut
4. add **er**
5. add **er** + umlaut
6. add **s**

negative articles
- **nicht** is the negation word
- put before a verb *the entire sentence is negated*
- otherwise it just negates the element and can be just thought as "not"
- **kein/keine** is the negative form of *ein/eine* 
- **nichts - nothing** and **nie - never**
- there is also **un** and **im** (moglich - unmoglich; possible - impossible)


*more nouns*
- der (m), die (f), das (n) are the *articles* ("the" ...)
- er (m), sie (f), es (n) are used to continue referencing the noun *after it has been mentioned*

**compound nouns**
- the gender of the compound noun comes from the second noun
- 

**prefixes**
things like
- un, im, ("Ungluck" - bad luck)
- contra-, pro-, ("die Kontrarevolution")
- gegen- (means counter-, anti-, opposite)
- sonder- (means special or separate)

**Suffixes**
changes one word into a different word category
- -er: lernen; "to learn"
	- if we drop the "-en" then we have the *infinitive*
	- lern; "learn"
	- if we replace the "-en" with "-er" then we change the word to a *noun*
	- der lern*er*; "the learner"
- -heit: krank; "ill" becomes a noun if you add "-heit" to the ending
	- die Krankheit "the illness"
