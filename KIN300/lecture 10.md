intro to nutrition

optimal performance is a combination of *training, competition and health*

##### Metabolism
*metabolism:* the series of chemical in living organisms that create and break down energy necessary for life
*metabolic:* the rate at which your body expends energy or burns calories

the two classes of chemical processes that make up metabolism is *anabolism* and *catabolism*

##### anabolism - "growth"

set of metabolic reactions that require energy to synthesize (build) new molecules from simpler resources.

food intake sparks anabolism through biosynthetic pathways

##### catabolism - "destruction"

set of metabolic reactions that transforms fuel into (cellular) energy
- examples: 
	- Glycogenolysis - breakdown of glycogen to  glucose
	- Glycolysis - the breakdown of glucose/glycogen to pyruvate
