Canada Physical Guidelines
- says to get 150 min of vigorous to moderate activity per week
- we also need to be strong

*motor unit recruitment* is when we use more *muscle units* to produce *more force* in a contraction
- low intensity contraction -> recruit the low contract fibers
- higher intensity contraction -> recruit the low then high

*defn* resistance training is the repeated voluntary muscle contraction against a resistance greater than those normally encountered in activities of daily living

strength gains normally come in the order
- neural adaptation (beginner gains)
	- allows us to recruit units that we were not able to before
	- 
- hypertrophy (muscles get larger)

- fast twitch fibers grow the fastest

**resistance training variables**
- load
- volume (sets + reps)
- exercise sections


**studies**
- lift heavier get more strength
- lift less heavy but more volume get size but not strength


**check your understanding questions**
1. get 150 min of weekly activity, and become strong through resistance training at the gym 
	- get on push pull legs
	- load you can lift less than 15 times
2. increase nutrition and start resistance training more - light load training in combination with heavy load
	- more than one set, -> more volume (10-20 sets per muscle group)
	-
