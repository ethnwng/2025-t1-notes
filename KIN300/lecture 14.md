how does *protein* affect *muscle size*

**nutrition** does not affect muscle size as much as training does

**background info:**
what is a protein?
- what body is largely made of
- what enzymes are made of
*a protein is a chain of amino acids*

also eat protein in meats or like plant based stuff

two categories; *essential* and *non-essential*
- essential amino acids, the *body cannot make* so we are required to eat them
- non-essential amino acids, the *body can make*

three essential ones that are important
- leucine
- isoluecine
- valine
these are **bcaas** 

*government says we should consume 0.8 grams of protein per kg body mass per day*

where does this number come from?
- nitrogen balance study (looking at excretion and intake of nitrogen)

a study conducted where we feed people diets where we know the nitrogen intake then measure the nitrogen balance
- if a person is excreting more nitrogen then we are *losing protein* (idk how)
- 0.84 g/kg/day is the 2nd standard deviation to keep the nitrogen balance


*protien* does not affect the increase in *strength* that much

regular food better than supplements

*summary:*
to optimize gains in muscle mass following resistance exercise you should
- eat high quality proteins (essential amino acids)
- about 1.6 grams per kg/day seems optimal
- eat real food compared to supplements

*note:*
- excess of protein does not see big health consequences
