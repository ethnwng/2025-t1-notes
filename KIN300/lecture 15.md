# nutritional supplements
#### Protein
protein intake should be ~ 0.8 g of protein per kg of bodyweight. 
- the last lecturer said we go up to maybe double this amount but i think this is just guideline

so for me 76kg, thats
- 60.2g of protein per day using the 0.8 gram one 
- 120.4g of protein per day using the 1.6 gram

the last guy was saying that we should focus on eating *food based proteins* over *supplements* but this girl is saying sometimes thats hard so we can use supplements

**recommendations:**
- start people with 1.6g protein per kg of bodyweight
- could also prescribe protein amounts per meal instead
- we also want to have our meals be balanced with protein

whey protein vs casein protein
- whey is *faster* so it absorbs quicker
- casein is *slower* so it takes longer to effect
which is why whey is more expensive than casein

supplements are used for high performance athletes but for ordinary people its kinda whatever
- very unregulated 
- athletes can take a substance they think is legal but hes actually getting roids
- regulated by *world anti doping agency*

pretty much not as regulated as regular *pharmaceuticals*
- up to the wording of their marketing

**caffeine**
- the most widely available and accepted drug used 
- very specific amount used
- 3-6 mg per kilo ~ 45 min before event
- most of the time using tablets

**caffeine effect**
- decrease pain perception
- increases the effort barrier
- caffeine is used for literally every kind of athelte (team, power, skill)
- takes about 45 min to have effect
- takes 5 hours to be eliminated from body

**summary for supplements:**
- find an expert
- prioritize real food over supplements (protein, fiber)
- dont take supplements < 18 years old
- considerations: safety, effectiveness, and legality in sport?
