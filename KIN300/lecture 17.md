[[KIN300]] skeletal muscles have sensory receptors

**defn** *proprioceptive sense/proprioception* the sense of the position and movement of our body (how we know if we are lifting arm or something) comes from the sensory receptors in our skeletal muscles

- there are receptors in our *skin* and *joints*

these are examples of *mechanoreceptors* (receptors that respond to mechanical deformation)

there are *receptors* called *muscle spindles* which are like coils that wrap around tissue, when the muscle stretches or contract so does the wind

another kind of *receptor* are along the tendon called *golgi tendon organs (gto)* 

**reflexes**
- like auto reflexes responses that we do (pain withdrawal, stretch reflex)
- pain: hurting foot or something
- stretch: dr hitting the knee with hammer to get it to flex out
	- this happens when doctor hits the receptor 

These reflexes are controlled from our spinal cord, the brain does even have a response. 

when theres pain all the muscles that control flexion retract and then everything else will contract

**rhythmically generated movements**
- break brainstem then its gg

we are so smart that some responses only happen in certain scenarios
- tripping reflex only occurs when our foot is not on the floor

*walking = locomotion*

**motor cortex** is used when accuracy is invovled
- walking down stairs
