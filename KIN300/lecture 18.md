**guest speaker on muscle fatigue**

strength is just the force outputted by our muscles

q: how do we measure?
- 1 rep max
- perceptual measurement
- dynamometry (machine)

what causes reduction in muscle strength?
- injury
- disease
- fatigue

**muscle fatigue:** an *exercise induced* reduction in a muscles capacity to generate force
- key property: you can recover back to the maximal 
ex: you get a guy to do a dynamometry measurement and measure their max force, then he goes and exercises, when he comes back immediately after and does another measurement the max force output is going to be *lower*

the *neuromuscular pathway* is like the road that sends signals from the brain to muscles
- it connects the primary motor cortex to the motor neuron to the muscle
- *any* disruption on this road *is a cause for muscle fatigue*

the *neuromuscular junction* is pretty much just the muscle.
