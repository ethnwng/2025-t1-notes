METS are units
- is the *ratio* of the metabolic rate during a physical activity *compared* to the resting metabolic rate

$1$ MET is equivalent to:
- 3.5 ml of oxygen consumed per bodyweight (kg) over time (minutes)
or
- ~1 kcal per body weight over time (hours)

for a 40 year old 70kg male

*Canadian 24 hour movement guidelines*
the reccomendation of $150$ min per week of physical activity comes from the hazard curve

looking at the 10 year point we have ~ $10$ MET-hour per week
so
$$
\begin{align}
10\text{ MET}-\text{hr/week} &= 600\text{ MET}-\text{min/week} \\
\frac{600}{4} \text{ MET} &= 150 \text{ min/week}
\end{align}
$$
- $4$ came from *moderate intensity physical activity* being $4.0$ METS
