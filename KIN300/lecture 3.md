another PA example

some guy walks 15 minutes a day what is his physical activity level in MET-hr/week

- walking is $2.0\text{ METs}$
$$
\begin{align}
2.0\text{ METS} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day}\cdot 7\text{ days/week} = 7\text{ METs-hr/week}
\end{align}
$$

so the guy is getting $7.0$ METs per day, reccomend some sort of activity that gets him to $10.0$ METs the recommended amount

*active couch potato* is someone who is physically active (meets some METs/week count) but is also slightly sedentary.
- studies are showing that just being active (>> some MET threshhold) is better than not being active,
- but if you compare to other people with similar MET but are not sedentary as well you are worse off
