*defn:* Fitness is the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness without undue fatigue and with am;ple energy to enjoy pursuits and to meet unforseen emergencies

*defn:* Physical fitness is operationalized as a set of measurable health and skill-related attributes

###### components related to fitness
- *cardio endurance* 
- *strength* 
- *muscular endurance*
- *flexibility* 
- **body composition** - the proportion of fat vs fat-free mass (muscle, bone, organs, connective tissue, vasculature, water)

##### cardio endurance
- ability of the circulatory and respiratory system to provide fuel during sustained physical activity
- the ability to perform sustained, dynamic exercise using large muscle groups

relies on
- lungs to take in air
- heart to pump blood
- blood vessels to deliver blood to the working muscles
- muscles to use the oxygen+nutrients/fuel (carbs, glucose) to generate ATP (energy)

##### strength
- the amount of external force that a muscle can exert
- determined by the structure and neural control of muscle

maximal strength is measured by the *1-RM* (one rep max)
- can also estimate 1-RM by doing sub-maximal tests


##### muscle endurance
- ability of muscle to *hold* a contraction for a long period of time or *contract* a muscle *over and over*

relies on:
- *anaerobic capacity* the ability to make ATP without oxygen

a different (?) kind is *muscle power*
- combo of strength and endurance
sometimes called explosive strength

##### flexibility
- ability to move joints through their full range of motion

relies on:
- joint structure
- connective tissue
-
