the size of the muscle group affect the recorded $VO_{2}$ max values
- the larger the muscle the more oxygen is required to fuel it therefore a higher $VO_{2}$ max

algorithms that estimate $VO_{2}$ max use the idea of muscle group sizes to figure make estimates like the one used in worldfitnesslevel.org

someone who is more fit will have a lower resting hr. -> this can be used to estimate the $VO_{2}$ max of two different people
