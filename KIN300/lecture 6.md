#### Skeletal Muscles:

Striated muscle - skeletal + cardiac muscle, *striped*

skeletal muscle - possible to voluntarily control
cardiac + smooth muscle - under involuntary control (reflex, cramps, we cannot voluntarily control our heartbeat)

**properties of muscle:**
- electrical excitability
	- neurons
- contractility
	- shortening and thickening; creates the force of our muscles
- extensibility
	- stretching (normally) does not damage
- elasticity
	- can return back to original shape after contraction/stretch

organization of the human body
- organs (either nervous or musculoskeletal)
	- composed of
		- muscle tissue
		- connective tissue
		- nervous tissue
		- blood/vascular tissue


*muscles* connect to the *skeleton* and the *tension* creates force on our skeleton to create movement
- the connection of the muscle to the skeleton is done with *tendons* (or connective tissues (?))


**connective tissues components**
- epimysium - around the whole muscle
- endomysium - around a single cell
- perimysium - around the fascicle (bundle of muscle cells)

*aponeurosis:* a connective tissue for *flat* muscles (like the abs)

not all muscles connect to the bones (facial) 

the *skeletal muscle* is made up of
- fascicle 
- muscle fibre cell
- myofibril (only in muscle)

each one encompasses the next so fascicle is filled with muscle fibre cells which are filled with myofibril

*muscle cells* are cylindrical and
- the *plasma membrane*  is called the **sarcolemma**
- the *intracellular fluid/cytoplasm* is called the **sarcoplasm**
- the *contractile organelles* is called the **myofibrils** (not the same as myofiber) and *generate the muscle contraction*
- the *myofibrils* consist of *thick/thin* **filaments**, the stripes are the filaments in diagrams
