there are three main kinds of muscles in the body
- skeletal <- we focus on this one
- smooth
- cardiac
#### Biological Composition simplified
In a descending sort of tree like manner
- everything is made of atoms
- atoms combine together to make molecules
- molecules combine to make elements
- organic cells' are pretty much combinations of molecules

**simple structure of a cell**
- cells all have an outer membrane
- inside them they all have organelles

- cells organize themselves to create *tissue*
- tissue are just similar cells that work together to perform a specific function
- tissue's are either *muscular, epithelial, nervous, or connective*
- tissues combine to make organs
- organs are combinations of two or more tissues (stomach)
- combinations of organs make organ systems (digestive system = stomach + intestines + ...)

looking at the muscular system
- an organ would be like (biceps)

#### Skeletal Muscles:
striated muscle - skeletal + cardiac muscle, *striped*
skeletal muscle - possible to voluntarily control
cardiac + smooth muscle - under involuntary control (reflex, cramps, we cannot voluntarily control our heartbeat)

**properties of muscle:**
- electrical excitability
	- neurons
- contractility
	- shortening and thickening; creates the force of our muscles
- extensibility
	- stretching (normally) does not damage
- elasticity
	- can return back to original shape after contraction/stretch

organization of the human body
- organs (either nervous or musculoskeletal)
	- composed of
		- muscle tissue
		- connective tissue
		- nervous tissue
		- blood/vascular tissue


*muscles* connect to the *skeleton* and the *tension* creates force on our skeleton to create movement
- the connection of the muscle to the skeleton is done with *tendons* (or connective tissues (?))


**connective tissues components**
- epimysium - around the whole muscle
- endomysium - around a single cell
- perimysium - around the fascicle (bundle of muscle cells)

**organization of an individual muscle**
- muscle fibers (synonymous with muscle cell) are grouped together and surrounded by the *endomysium*
- a *fascicle* is just these grouped up and surrounded by the *perimysium*
- group a bunch of those up and surround them by a epimysium and we get one *skeletal muscle*

these skeletal muscles then taper towards a *tendon* which is the component that actually connects the muscle to the bone

*aponeurosis:* a connective tissue for *flat* muscles (like the abs)
*note:* not all muscles connect to the bones (facial) 

the *anatomic makeup* of muscles:
- we know that *fascicle* are just groups of *muscle fibers* that are surrounded by endomysium
- *muscle fibers* (also called muscle cells) are made up of *myofibrils*

*muscle cells* are cylindrical and
- the *plasma membrane*  is called the **sarcolemma**
- the *intracellular fluid/cytoplasm* is called the **sarcoplasm**
- the *contractile organelles* is called the **myofibrils** (not the same as myofiber) and *generate the muscle contraction*
- the *myofibrils* consist of *thick/thin* **filaments**, the stripes are the filaments in diagrams

*motivating question:* how does the skeletal muscle actually contract?
*ans:* the sarcomere is the small component that makes it so that the overall muscle contracts

-> we are continuing to get microscopic on muscle tissues

the tiniest (?) part of the muscle cell is the *myofibril*, which is composed of thick and thin filaments and has repeating things called *z* discs
- each **z disc** are regions on the myofibril which are repeated
- a single *z disc* region is called a **sarcomere**

each *sarcomere* is divided into
- thick filaments (myosin)
and
- thin filaments (actin)
there are 4 bands/areas of interest
- *I band, H band, Z disk, A band*
- no idea what these do

**thick filaments**
are made out of *myosin* (which are a protein)
- they have their tails pointing inwards (toward eachother?)
- they have globular heads that point outwards, like a two-sided head

**thin filaments**
molecularly, they are made up of *actin (molecule), troponin (protein), & tropomyosin (protein)*
- think of it as
	- actin are these bead like molecules
	- tropomyosin is a string that wraps around and groups the actin
	- troponin is the glue (or lock) that keeps everything together
this entire thing forms *one thin filament*

actin (from thin filament) and myosin (from thick filament) are initially **inhibited** from each other by a *troponin protein*

**troponin**
- each troponin protein has *three* binding sites.
	- one for the tropomyosin
	- one for the actin
	- one for Ca$^{2+}$ atoms

**activation stage**
when troponin reacts with Calcium the *inhibitor* is removed allowing for the *actin* in the thin filament to react with the *myosin* from the large filament 
- a **cross bridge** is formed when the *actin* and *myosin* bind
- the thick filament and thin filament slide over each other shrinking the size of the *sarcomere* called the **power stroke**
this is the *contraction* of the muscle
