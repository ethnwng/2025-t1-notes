[[KIN300]]

*sarcomeres* have an organization of thick and thin filaments in an alternating like pattern.
- Each row is connected with a protein disc
- each sarcomere is separated by these discs
-

*structure* of the *thick filaments*
- made up of ~300 myosin protein
- tail pointing toward the center
- globular head pointing outward

myosin proteins look like two golf clubs placed back to back 

on the head there are *binding sites* which can bind with *actin* (another molecule)

theres another site where the myosin ATPase (enzyme) can bind

*thick filaments*
- looks like the golf club, 
- actin is the building site/material
- it combined with tropomyosin 


*myosin* combines in a helical shape with *tropomyosin* locked in by *troponin*.
