some review:

the *contractile proteins* are
- myosin
- actin

the *regulatory proteins* are
- tropomyosin
- troponin

the *thin filaments* are then made up of
- actin
- tropomyosin
- troponin
##### muscle metabolism
- ATP is the fuel for the cross-bridge / contraction cycle

how do muscles derive the ATP necessary to power the contraction?
- creatine phosphate
- aerobic cellular respiration
- anaerobic glycolysis

*aerobic* is the oxygen $O_{2}$ consuming process
*glycolysis* is the breakdown of *glucose* (sugar) and does not require $O_{2}$

##### Methods to get ATP
**creatine phosphate** (phosphocreatine)
the system starts with the chemical process:

$$
ATP\ from \ metabolism+creatine \to ADP +phosphocreatine
$$
which happens when our *muscles are resting* (sleep)

then when we go to *work our muscles* the chemical process:
$$
phosphocreatine + ADP \longrightarrow creatine +ATP
$$
occurs.

The creatine phosphate system:
- the breakdown/reformation of phosphocreatine
- this does not require oxygen so is *anaerobic* 
- takes place in sarcoplasm (no organelles required)
- associated with fast twitch muscle fibres
- supports ~15 seconds of maximum all-out activity
- good for powerlifting

**glycolysis**
- anaerobic process
- the breakdown of glucose

we get *glucose* from two areas
- the blood stream
- muscle glycogen

then
$$
\text{glucose} \to \text{break down through glycolysis: +2 ATP} \to \text{pyruvic/pyruvate acid} \to \text{lactic acid} \to \text{into blood}
$$
b 
- lactic acid can be converted into glucose 
- can be used in $O_{2}$ consuming reactions
- can power ~2-3 minutes of all out activity
- good for long distance?


**aerobic system**
- *aerobics* mean it requires or uses $O_{2}$ unlike the other two which do not require oxygen
the oxygen used in the system comes from two places:
- hemoglobin in blood
- myoglobin from muscle fibres

**comparison of system**
- one glucose can create ~$36$ ATP
- one fatty acid can create ~$100$ ATP
- we try to not break down protein which occurs during like a starvation scenario

well-trained athletes will use up the lactate and lactic acid in the blood better than someone who is untrained
- what this means is that the amount of lactic acid in the blood for someone who is trained will be *lower* than someone who is *untrained*
- this includes both endurance and strength exercises

##### Muscle Fibres
There are *3* muscle fibre types
- Type I: slow oxidative fibres
- Type IIa: fast oxidative-glycolytic fibre
- Type IIx: fast glycolytic fibres


**type I**
- they are the (smal)
