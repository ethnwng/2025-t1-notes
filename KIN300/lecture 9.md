muscle contraction features
- speed
- tension/force output (strength)
- endurance capacity (muscular endurance)

each have their own mechanism
- speed : the type of myosin protein -> myosin ATphase
- tension : number of cross bridges we can make (related to size)
- endurance capacity : metabolic pathway: (aerobic, anaerobic)



contraction cycle
- release calcium from the sarcolemma
- calcium binds to the troponin and creates the the cross-bridge reaction(myosin-actin binding)

the release of calcium starts from the *nervous system*
- *motor neuron* from brain travels through the spinal cord and on the *neural muscular junction*
- the *motor neuron* triggers the release of ACh in the *nmj*
- the *ACh* goes to the sarcolemma and causes the release of calcium

-> botox blocks the ability for the ACh to go to the sarcolemma effectively paralyzing the muscle since the calcium would never be released

*defn* a **motor unit** is $1$ motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates

two methods to *increase tension:*
1. increase frequency of stimulation
	- send more signals
2. recruit more motor units (recruit more muscle fibers)
	- get more muscle fibers
	- normally recruit gradually depending on how much power is needed over time

the size of motor units is related to the size of the muscle fiber
- smaller motor units control *fine and delicate* movemnts (hands, mouth, eyeballs)
- large motor units like quads, back, chest

*effects:*
increase in motor units usage increase the calories burned and therefore is good for weight loss
