*physical activity* - any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that result in energy expenditure above resting (basal) levels
- literally any kind of movement

*exercise* - any *PA* that is *planned, structured, and repetitive* with the *objective* of maintaining or improving


researchers who want to answer
- how much movement
- how much energy
people do use
- devices (e.g accelerometers (e.g apple watch))
- questionnaires

*devices* like *accelerometers* are methods that researchers use to collect data on physical activity

*questionnaires* are used to quantify *duration* and *intensity*. the **International Physical Activity Questionnaire** (IPAQ) is a popular standard 

it asks the amount of:
- vigorous activity
- moderate activity
- walking
- sitting

done by a person in the last 7 days, 

where the vigorous and moderate activities are split into *long* and *short* form activities as well as split into "time" cohorts like
- occupation (desk job vs construction)
- active transport (drive vs bike to work)
- domestic
- leisure time (gym, basketball)

a *vigorous activity* is one that take *hard* physical effort and make you *breathe hard* 
- heavy lifts, digging, aerobics

a *moderate activity* is one that take *moderate* physical effort and make you *breathe somewhat harder than normal*
- carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, doubles tennis

IPAQ score is given by the summation of 

vigorous activity = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 8.0\text{ METs}$
moderate activity = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 4.0\text{ METs}$
walking = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 3.3\text{ METs}$

so
$$
IPAQ \ score = \sum \text{ vigorous activity METs} + \text{ moderate activity METs} + \text{walking METs}
$$
if you are
- 3 or more days of vigorous activity of atleast 20 min, OR
- 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and.or waling of at least 30 min per day, OR
- 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activities achieving a min of 600 MET-min/week
then you are in the **moderate** category based on IPAQ

if you are
- vigorours intense activity on atleast 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-min/week, OR
- 7 or more days of any combo of walking, moderate/vigorous intensity activities accumulating at least 3000 MET-min/week
then you are in the **high** category based on IPAQ

else you are in the **low**

**METs** are units which are equivalent to
- 3.5 ml $O_{2}$/kg/min
- 1 kcal/kg/hr
for a "typical" 40 year old 70 kg male

METs provide a ratio of the metabolic rate during a PA to the resting

**other methods of PA intensity**
- Talk test
	- a range from 1-10 which pretty much scores someones ability to speak after doing physical activity
	- 1 is like able to talk and sing a song
	- 5 is like able to talk but not sing
	- 10 is pausing between words
- heart rate/ pulse
- sweatiness
- borg's rating of perceived exertion
	- rating from 6 to 20 
	- 6 being no exertion
	- 6-13 represents light work (extremely, very, light)
	- 13-19 represents hard work (somewhat, very, extremely)
	- 20 is maximal exertion
- Aerobic Heartrate zones
	- zones from 1-5 which measure the heart rate 
	- 1: active recovery
	- 2: aerobic endurance
	- 3: tempo
	- 4: threshold
	- 5: VO2max

sympathetic nervous system:
the *fight or flight* response is the most dominant during *exercise* (not PA)

when you are *exercising* there are increasing
- blood to working muscle
- heart rate
- breathing
- sweating
(heart rate, breathing, and sweating are *symptomatic* indicators of PA/exercise intensity)

**Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines**
- move more
- reduce sedentary time
- sleep well

*isotemporal* - is time spent moving vs sitting vs sleeping

the guidelines state
- have 150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic PA 
- several hours of light PA
- sleep 7 to 9 hours
- limit sedentary time to 8 hours
- 3 hours max of screentime
- break up long periods of sitting

an *exercise snack* is some sort of *intense burst of activity* for about 1-5 min at a time
