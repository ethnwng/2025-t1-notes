*physical activity* - any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that result in energy expenditure above resting (basal) levels
- literally any kind of movement

*exercise* - any *PA* that is *planned, structured, and repetitive* with the *objective* of maintaining or improving


researchers who want to answer
- how much movement
- how much energy
people do use
- devices (e.g accelerometers (e.g apple watch))
- questionnaires

*devices* like *accelerometers* are methods that researchers use to collect data on physical activity

*questionnaires* are used to quantify *duration* and *intensity*. the **International Physical Activity Questionnaire** (IPAQ) is a popular standard 

it asks the amount of:
- vigorous activity
- moderate activity
- walking
- sitting

done by a person in the last 7 days, 

where the vigorous and moderate activities are split into *long* and *short* form activities as well as split into "time" cohorts like
- occupation (desk job vs construction)
- active transport (drive vs bike to work)
- domestic
- leisure time (gym, basketball)

a *vigorous activity* is one that take *hard* physical effort and make you *breathe hard* 
- heavy lifts, digging, aerobics

a *moderate activity* is one that take *moderate* physical effort and make you *breathe somewhat harder than normal*
- carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, doubles tennis

IPAQ score is given by the summation of 

vigorous activity = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 8.0\text{ METs}$
moderate activity = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 4.0\text{ METs}$
walking = $\# \text{ of days per week}\times \#\text{ of minutes per day} \times 3.3\text{ METs}$

so
$$
IPAQ \ score = \sum \text{ vigorous activity METs} + \text{ moderate activity METs} + \text{walking METs}
$$
if you are
- 3 or more days of vigorous activity of atleast 20 min, OR
- 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and.or waling of at least 30 min per day, OR
- 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activities achieving a min of 600 MET-min/week
then you are in the **moderate** category based on IPAQ

if you are
- vigorours intense activity on atleast 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-min/week, OR
- 7 or more days of any combo of walking, moderate/vigorous intensity activities accumulating at least 3000 MET-min/week
then you are in the **high** category based on IPAQ

else you are in the **low**

**METs** are units which are equivalent to
- 3.5 ml $O_{2}$/kg/min
- 1 kcal/kg/hr
for a "typical" 40 year old 70 kg male

METs provide a ratio of the metabolic rate during a PA to the resting

**other methods of PA intensity**
- Talk test
	- a range from 1-10 which pretty much scores someones ability to speak after doing physical activity
	- 1 is like able to talk and sing a song
	- 5 is like able to talk but not sing
	- 10 is pausing between words
- heart rate/ pulse
- sweatiness
- borg's rating of perceived exertion
	- rating from 6 to 20 
	- 6 being no exertion
	- 6-13 represents light work (extremely, very, light)
	- 13-19 represents hard work (somewhat, very, extremely)
	- 20 is maximal exertion
- Aerobic Heartrate zones
	- zones from 1-5 which measure the heart rate 
	- 1: active recovery
	- 2: aerobic endurance
	- 3: tempo
	- 4: threshold
	- 5: VO2max

sympathetic nervous system:
the *fight or flight* response is the most dominant during *exercise* (not PA)

when you are *exercising* there are increasing
- blood to working muscle
- heart rate
- breathing
- sweating
(heart rate, breathing, and sweating are *symptomatic* indicators of PA/exercise intensity)

**Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines**
- move more
- reduce sedentary time
- sleep well

*isotemporal* - is time spent moving vs sitting vs sleeping

the guidelines state
- have 150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic PA 
- several hours of light PA
- sleep 7 to 9 hours
- limit sedentary time to 8 hours
- 3 hours max of screentime
- break up long periods of sitting

an *exercise snack* is some sort of *intense burst of activity* for about 1-5 min at a time

*fitness* is the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness without undue fatigue and with ample energy to enjoy pursuits

*physical fitness* is operationalized as a set of **measurable health and skill-related attributes** that allows the body to respond or adapt to the demands and stress of physical effort

**health components of fitness**
- cardiorespiratory endurance: measure of circulatory and respiratory systems to provide fuel during sustained PA
- strength: the amount of force a muscle can exert
- muscle endurance: the duration a muscle can exert a force either holding or continuous
- flexibility: ability to move joints through their full range of motion
- body composition: proportion of fat vs. fat-free mass

cardio endurance relies on:
- lungs to get air $O_{2}$
- heart to pump blood
- blood vessels to hold $O_{2}$ and nutrients
- muscles to utilize the $O_{2}$ and nutrients

strength is just the max amount of weight you can lift
- measured by a 1 rep max
- could also estimate the 1 rep max as
$$
1RM = weight\times(1.0278 - (0.0278 \times reps))
$$
muscular endurance is just the ability to maintain high-intensity on repetitive or static exercise
- usually activity of 1-2 min duration
- involve the fast twitch muscle fibers
- relies on anaerobic capacity 

flexibility is the ability to move the joints through their full range of motion, relies on
- joint structure
- connective tissue
- nervous system activity
can be improved with regular stretching, and proprioceptive neuromuscular activity

**skill related physical fitness**
- power: power is just a combination of strength and speed 
- agility: the ability to rapidly change position of the body with speed and accuracy
- speed: the ability the perform a movement quickly
- coordination: the ability to use the senses together with motor commands to perform tasks smoothly and accurately
- reaction time: the ability to respond or react quickly to a stimulus
- balance: the ability to maintain equilibrium while moving or while stationary

**measuring fitness**
1. lab based measures
2. questionnaires
3. home-based, "simple" clinical tests

cardio endurance assessments:
- gold standard is VO$_{2}$ max test, uses a CPET
	- treadmill or bicycle ergometer (target large muscles)
	- metabolic cart (measures concentration of $O_{2}$ and $CO_{2}$ of inhaled and exhaled air)

graded exercise protocol intensity progressively increased until $VO_{2}$ plateaus or exhaustion

tldr: measures how much oxygen you use

its based on *size* of muscles used so if an athlete uses more muscles (cross country skiing) compared to others they would technically have a higher *VO*$_{2}$ max.

there are also formulas that estimate maximal oxygen uptake

*Heart Rate Recovery (HRR)* is the change in heart rate after cessation of exercise over a given duration

can be used to indicate changes in fitness
- athletes: HR dropped by 23 bpm after 1 min of rest
- average person: HR drop by 15-25 after 1 min of rest

trained individuals have more parasympathetic tone
- a lower heart rate at the end of an exercise

there is a linear relationship between *VO2* and *HR* during sub-maximal exercise. 
- as VO2 goes up, so does the HR
- makes sense as you suck in more air your hearts gotta beat faster to pump it throughout ur body

if you are more fit, it means that your heart doesn't have to pump as hard to deliver the oxygen you are consuming, thus lower HR

the study of *grip* strength is also used for general fitness because we do alot of work with our hands.
