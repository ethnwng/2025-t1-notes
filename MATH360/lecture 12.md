#### Monte Carlo Simulations
Given some stochastic problem (a problem where randomness is a factor), monte-carlo is just *continuously* random sampling $n$ times to see what patterns arise.

- Monte-Carlo is very time and compute expensive
- Can be the best method for a problem (high dimension integration) but also because of its cost not always the best
