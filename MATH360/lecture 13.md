*motivation:* we have a random variable with a bunch of data points. what is the partial density function for this random variable? what is the distribution of the rv?

we have to options:
- plot the histogram (bad)
- use kernal density equation

*histograms* are bad for small sized data sets because the choice of *bin* matters alot to the perceived distribution of the data

instead we use a KDF since its a *functional* way to use the *datapoints* to create an *estimate* for the distribution.
