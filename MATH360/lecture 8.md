[[MATH360]]

##### Governing Equation
- come from a conservation principle
	- conservation of mass/energy/charge/energy
- free energy calculations

##### Constitutive Relationships
- connect conservation principle to context
- generally couple a quantity to how it moves in the system
- ex: Hooke's Law (how a spring acts in a conservation of energy equation)

Big Idea:
- What is the conservation principle?
- What are the relationships you need to connect the principle to the problem
