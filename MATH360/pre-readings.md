### Modelling Processes
Like writing a paper there is a structure to models.

**1. Problem Statement:** problems are open-ended, having a clear problem statement makes it more clear on the end goal

**2. Variables and Parameters:** 
*defn* a variable is an unknown quantity. They can be either *independent* or *dependent*.

*defn* a independent variable is an unknown quantity that is an *input to a system*

*defn* a dependent variable is an unknown quantity that is an *output to a system* *given* some independent variable 

*defn* a parameter are quantities that appear from the relationships between variables

*defn* (?) a dimension is things like length, time, mass


**3. Assumptions and Constraints:** setting assumptions is done to reduce the complexity of the overall problem, constraints further outline the problem statement

**4. Building Solutions:** the tools used to actually make the model as well as the type of model being used (stochastic, deterministic, data-driven)

**5. Analysis and Validation:** interpreting the created model and assessing the overall quality of the model. ask our selves
- does the solution make sense wit respect to the problem
- does the solution answer the problem
- are the results reasonable/practical
if there are errors we work backwards to find the issue

**6. Reporting:** just write a paper on it or something
